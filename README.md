# Discourse Custom Layouts

Is a plugin enabling administrators to change the way a specific topic or post shall be rendered. It can do that based on the archetype or via custom-fields â€“ where custom fields has priority. Only if a template for the archetype is found it will be taken (suffixed with '_topic' and '_post' respectively), the fallback is to always use the default template.

## Configuration

This adds a new configuration setting:

  - custom_layout_per_archetype: whether or not it should try and lookup based on the archetype. This allows also for easy overwriting of the default style by adding a "regular_topic"-template in the path. Default: false.


## Installation

Just two easy steps. From your main discourse do:

    cd plugins
    git clone https://github.com/ligthyear/discourse-plugin-custom-content-layour.git   # clone the repo here
    cd ..
    RAILS_ENV=production rake assets:precompile

Then restart your discourse and enjoy.
